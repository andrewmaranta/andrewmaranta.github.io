Heart disease is
the No. 1 cause

00:00:06.542 --> 00:00:08.918
of death in both men
and women globally

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.375
and claims more lives than
all forms of cancer combined.

00:00:13.542 --> 00:00:16.167
Cardiac arrest may be caused
by almost any known heart

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.125
condition and is often
fatal if appropriate steps

00:00:19.209 --> 00:00:21.292
aren't taken immediately.

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:23.459
Cardiac arrest does
not discriminate.

00:00:23.542 --> 00:00:26.834
It can affect all ages,
genders, nationalities,

00:00:26.918 --> 00:00:28.542
and races.

00:00:28.626 --> 00:00:32.626
This is why early recognition
and immediate cardiopulmonary

00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:38.459
resuscitation, or CPR, are crucial
for survival from cardiac arrest.

00:00:38.792 --> 00:00:41.667
Healthcare providers are the
backbone of the systems of care,

00:00:41.751 --> 00:00:45.459
in both the community and
medical facilities.

00:00:45.542 --> 00:00:48.501
Advanced rescue measures cannot
be successful on their own

00:00:48.584 --> 00:00:52.876
without solid basic
life support, or BLS.

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:55.334
This training will guide you
through the key practices

00:00:55.417 --> 00:00:56.792
of high-quality BLS.

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:06.000
Products are shown for
demonstration purposes only.

00:01:06.083 --> 00:01:08.125
Heart & Stroke does not
endorse or recommend

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:11.292
any specific
manufacturer or product.

00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:13.501
In order to show skills
clearly, the healthcare

00:01:13.584 --> 00:01:15.459
providers in this
video do not always

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:17.834
use recommended personal
protective equipment,

00:01:17.918 --> 00:01:19.584
such as gloves.

00:01:19.667 --> 00:01:23.542
Heart & Stroke recognises that heart disease
and stroke is the number one 

00:01:23.626 --> 00:01:26.709
cause of premature death in woman
in Canada

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:29.125
However,
skills in this video

00:01:29.167 --> 00:01:31.292
will be demonstrated
on male victims

00:01:31.334 --> 00:01:34.876
to respect cultural awareness
and sensitivity.
